# QG_tracer_advection
Passive tracer flow using quasigeostrophic flow

Hi all!

I have set up this repository so you can see the modifcations I have made to the tracer advection module.

It can now take in a MultiLayerQG.Problem and use the QG flow the problem produces to advect a tracer (at least that is what it looks like it is doing)!

Be great to have your thoughts!

If it looks to be doing the right thing I am happy to add it to the PassiveTracerAdvection module (provided Navid and Greg are happy about this!)

Thanks very much!
